<!-- -----------Mounting---------
Mounting means putting elements into the DOM.

React has four built-in methods that gets called, in this order, when mounting a component:

constructor()
getDerivedStateFromProps()
render()
componentDidMount()
The render() method is required and will always be called, the others are optional and will be called if you define them. -->




<!-- getDerivedStateFromProps() is a static method that is called whenever there is a change in the component's props. This method takes the props and the current state of the component as arguments and returns a new state object. The new state object is then used to update the component's state. -->



<!-- The componentDidMount() method is called once the component has been mounted into the DOM. It is typically used to set up any necessary event listeners or timers, perform any necessary API calls or data fetching, and perform other initialization tasks that require access to the browser's DOM API. -->



<!------------ Updating -----------
The next phase in the lifecycle is when a component is updated.

A component is updated whenever there is a change in the component's state or props.

React has five built-in methods that gets called, in this order, when a component is updated:

getDerivedStateFromProps()
shouldComponentUpdate()
render()
getSnapshotBeforeUpdate()
componentDidUpdate()
The render() method is required and will always be called, the others are optional and will be called if you define them. -->
